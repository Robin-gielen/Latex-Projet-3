\section*{Abstract} 

In the context of our first bachelor year in computer science, we had to carry out a group project. This project involving a significant amount of work, a group cohesion needed to work properly and efficiently together and the learning of new concepts related to computer science.The main objective was to create a programme capable of reading and generating 2D bare-codes with a specific format named CB2D. The different tasks were to design and code the programme, to think about the consequences of using QR-Codes instead of CB2D in our programme and finally the writing of this report about our work. In the end, we successfully created the demanded programme according to the specifications. About the implementation of QR-Code, we discuss about it in our report.
